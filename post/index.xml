      <description>Hello! If this post is visible then I have not finished migrating the old posts into gohugoio/hugo&amp;rsquo;s format yet.
The main goal of this blog is to showcase small projects and share insight I have gained in security, nautral language processing, and computers in general. You can also expect to see many CTF problem writeups as I revisit old problems and solve new ones.
Thanks for stopping by. If you have any questions or comments send me an email at cganas-anon@forward.</description>
